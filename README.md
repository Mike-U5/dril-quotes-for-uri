# Npc Dialogue Replacer
Allows you to replace Uri's quotes with custom ones.
The FULL path to this file must first be set in the config.
EG: C:\Users\user\every_dril_tweet_ever_made.txt

The file should be a regular text file where every new line contains a new quote.
You should use &lt;br&gt; tags to separate lines in the game's chatbox.
Lines starting with # or // are ignored.
